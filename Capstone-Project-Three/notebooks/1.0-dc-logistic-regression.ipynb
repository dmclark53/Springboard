    "# Logistic Regression Model\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Leukemia is a type of cancer of the blood that often affects young people. In the past, pathologists would diagnose patients by eye after examining blood smear images under the microscope. But, this is time consuming and tedious. Advances in image recognition technology have come a long ways since their inception. Therefore, automated solutions using computers would be of great benefit to the medical community to aid in cancer diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to address the following question: How can the doctorâ€™s at the Munich University Hospital automate the diagnosis of patients with leukemia using images from blood smears?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "In this notebook, I will try a simple logistic regression model on the dataset of flattened images. I will not consider class imbalance at this time, but will examain the results of the model at the end."
