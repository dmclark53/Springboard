Capstone-Project-Three
==============================

This project is part of my final capstone project for the Data Science Career Track program at Springboard.

## Business Problem
Leukemia is a type of cancer of the blood that often affects young people. In the past, pathologists would diagnose patients by eye after examining blood smear images under the microscope. But, this is time consuming and tedious. Advances in image recognition technology have come a long ways since their inception. Therefore, automated solutions using computers would be of great benefit to the medical community to aid in cancer diagnoses.

The goal of this project is to address the following question: How can the doctorâ€™s at the Munich University Hospital automate the diagnosis of patients with leukemia using images from blood smears?

## Background

This work is based off the [A Single-cell Morphological Dataset of Leukocytes from AML Patients and Non-malignant Controls (AML-Cytomorphology_LMU)](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61080958#61080958bcab02c187174a288dbcbf95d26179e8) dataset taken from the Cancer Imaging Archive.
